      <p>Drip irrigation or trickle irrigation is a type of micro-irrigation system that has the potential to save water and nutrients by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants, either from above the soil surface or buried below the surface.</p>
    
      <h4>Advantages of Drip Irrigation:
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Maximum use of available water.</li>
        <li>No water being available to weeds.</li>
        <li>Maximum crop yield.</li>
        <li>High efficiency in the use of fertilizers.</li>
        <li>Less weed growth and restricts population of potential hosts.</li>
        <li>Low labour and relatively low operation cost.</li>
        <li>No soil erosion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Drip irrigation is <b>the most efficient water and nutrient delivery system for growing crops</b>. It delivers water and nutrients directly to the plant's roots zone, in the right amounts, at the right time, so each plant gets exactly what it needs, when it needs it, to grow optimally.
      </p>
      <p>Drip irrigation can use either <b>PVC pipe or polyethylene tubing</b> (or a combination of both). PVC systems are usually reserved for larger‐scale applications (like farming), while polyethylene tubing is the choice for home gardening.</p>

      <h4>Porous Soaker Hose</h4>
      <p>This is one of the best drip irrigation methods to use to get water to rows of shrubs or plant beds. It produces the least among of evaporation because it allows the soil to absorb all of the water it releases. It directs the water to plant roots.</p>
      <p>Drip runs longer than other irrigation types — <b>45-60-minute</b> run times are not uncommon — so any leaks are magnified over a long run cycle.</p>
      <p><b>Drip irrigation systems will use less water and reduce waste</b>. Saving water and reducing consumption is important these days, and if that is high up on your list as well, then you may want to go with a drip irrigation system.
      </p>
      <p>Drip irrigation prevents overwatering. The system consists of interconnected drip irrigation tools such as emitters, hoses and valves. An emitter will consistently provide water to a plant's roots. Laying these tools out correctly will give the best results.</p>

      <h3 className='my-4'>Sprinkler irrigation</h3>
      <p>Sprinkler/spray irrigation is the method of applying water to a controlled manner in that is similar to rainfall. The water is distributed through a network that may consist of pumps, valves, pipes, and sprinklers. Irrigation sprinklers can be used for residential, industrial, and agricultural usage.</p>

      <p>Sprinkler irrigation is widely used because <b>it is versatile, adaptable to almost all crops, and affordable</b>. But it's not a perfect irrigation system. Spray irrigation is one of the most inefficient watering methods, wasting approximately 30 to 50% of the water applied through run-off and evaporation.</p>

      <p>Sprinkler irrigation is also called <b>overhead irrigation</b>. In this method of irrigation water is applied in the form of a spray or artificial rain. Water is sprayed into the air and allowed to fall on the ground surface somewhat resembling rainfall.</p>

      <p>Sprinkler irrigation is suited for <b>most row, field and tree crops</b> and water can be sprayed over or under the crop canopy. However, large sprinklers are not recommended for irrigation of delicate crops such as lettuce because the large water drops produced by the sprinklers may damage the crop.</p>

      <p>Sprinkler system : This system is used on the uneven land where less water is available.</p>

      <p>Micro Irrigation technology plays a vital role in Agriculture in saving water and increasing productivity through effective utilization of every drop of water. Micro Irrigation has received considerable attention from farmers for its perceived ability to contribute significantly to groundwater resources development, agricultural productivity and economic growth. Drip Irrigation System is a life saver for many farmers in Tamil Nadu, by enhancing the yield and quality of the produce. Increasing water scarcity and limited availability of labour has paved the way for implementation of Micro Irrigation scheme. Micro Irrigation technology improves water use efficiency by 40% - 60% by precise water application. Through fertigation technology, fertilizers are directly applied to the root zone in drip irrigation, hence fertilizer use efficiency is also increased.</p>
