      <h4 className='mt-4'>Hard rock region and Aquifers</h4>
      <h5>Aquifer Unit I – Weathered :
      </h5>
      <p>The western part of the Lower Cauvery aquifer system contains a hard rock region made up of gneissic and Charnockite rocks. 6762 square kilometres are made up of hard rock regions. 52 firkas are contained within the 5894 sq. km. Gniessic formation (Figure 3.2). The 530 sq. km. Charnockite formation is distributed across 14 firkas. Two aquifer units—Aquifer Unit-I, which is made up of weathered rocks, and Aquifer Unit-II, which is made up of fractured/jointed rocks—are formed by the hard rock formation.</p>

      <h5>Aquifer Unit II (Fractured/Jointed):</h5>
      <p>The gneissic and charnockitic formation are distributed throughout the weathered aquifer unit, which extends from the surface to 2.8 m bgl. It has a minimum thickness of 5 m, a maximum thickness of 28 m, and an average thickness of 15 m. Groundwater naturally occurs in an open environment. Transmissivity, an aquifer parameter, ranges from 91.2 to 35.65 m2 per day in this aquifer unit. This aquifer unit's specific yield ranges from 1% to 1.5%. This aquifer unit's average EC ranges from 580 to 5180 S/cm, making it generally safe for drinking. There are some isolated areas where the quality of the groundwater exceeds what is acceptable for drinking and irrigation.</p>

      <h4 className='Pre Monsoon Decadal Average Depth to Water'>GROUND WATER LEVELS</h4>
      <p>The depth to water level map (Figure 4.1) of the basin was created using the average pre-monsoon water level data collected over a ten-year period (May 2008–May 2017) by groundwater monitoring wells. Between 1.62 mbgl (Karumandapam, Thiruverambur block, Trichy district) and 27.80 mbgl (Solatharan, Keerapalayam block, Cuddalore district), the average depth to water level during the decade ranged. 1.5% of wells have water levels between 0 and 2 mbgl, while 50% of wells have levels between 2 and 5 mbgl. In 29% of wells, water levels greater than 5 to 10 mbgl are noted, and in 17%, water levels greater than 10 to 20 mbgl are noted.In 2% of wells, water levels greater than 20 to 40 mbgl are visible. A large portion of the basin has a water level between 2 and 10 mbgl. Eastern and coastal areas of the basin have water levels between 2 and 5 mbgl. The Western side of the basin has water levels between 5 and 10 mbgl. In the northwestern and southwestern borders of the basin, water levels of greater than 10 to 20 mbgl are seen.</p>

      <h4 className='mt-4'>Post monsoon Decadal Average Depth to Water Levels of Aquifer – I</h4>
      <p>The depth to water level map (Figure 4.2) of the basin was created using the average post-monsoon water level data for the ten-year period (January 2008–December 2017) of groundwater monitoring wells. Between 0.58 mbgl (Mannargudi, Mannargudi block, Tiruvarur district) and 23.80 mbgl (T. Murungapatti, Uppiliyapuram block, Tiruchy district), the average depth to water level during the decade ranged. 27% of wells have water levels between 0 and 2 mbgl, while 45% of wells have levels between 2 and 5 mbgl. In 17% of wells, water levels greater than 5 mbgl are seen. In 9% of wells, water levels greater than 10 mbgl are seen. In 2% of wells, water levels greater than 20 mbgl are seen.The average water level throughout the basin's eastern portion is less than 5 m bgl, whereas it ranges between 2 and 10 m bgl in the basin's central and western regions. Only in the basin's northwest corner is a deeper water level of = 10 m bgl seen.

      <h4 className='mt-4'>Water Level Trend</h4>
      <h5>Premonsoon</h5>
      <p>The groundwater level trend is a long-term behaviour indicator that reveals the recharge and draught components of the groundwater in the specified area.It is a composite reflection of the drought condition and annual recharge, followed by the cumulative effect at the conclusion of the study period. For the planning of sustainable groundwater development, trend is a crucial factor.In the observation wells, both escalating and descending trends can be seen. In 82% of the wells overall, the depth to water level has decreased over the past ten years. The percentage of wells with rising trends is only 12%. The minimum and maximum rates of decline in the declining trend are 4 cm/year and 1.27 m/year, respectively. 21% have recorded a decline of 20 to 40 cm/year, compared to 36% who have recorded a decline of less than 20 cm/year. 19% of the stations have recorded declines of 40 to 70 cm/year. A decline of more than 1 million per year has been observed in 1% of the population.</p>

      <h5>Post monsoon</h5>
      <p>In the observation wells, both escalating and descending trends can be seen. In total, 61% of the wells have observed a decline in depth water level over the past ten years.
      A rising trend has been observed in 39% of the wells. The minimum and maximum decline rates in the declining trend are 1 cm per year and 95 cm per year, respectively. About 39% of people have noted declines of under 20 cm/year, while 7% have noted declines of between 20 and 40 cm/year. Around 8% of the stations show a decline of 40 to 70 cm/year. A decline of 70 to 95 cm/year has been observed in 6%.
      The minimum rise in the upward trend is 2 cm per year, and the maximum rise is 67 cm per year. The wells' average annual rise is less than 20 cm.

      <h4 className='mt-4'>Artificial Recharge Plan</h4>
      <p>The potential volume of void space present within the weathered zone of the first aquifer of the basin has been estimated as 2748 MCM and tabulated in the following table based on the water level monitoring in various seasons across the basin as well as after having a better understanding of the disposition and extent of the aquifer system through exploratory drilling, pumping tests, etc.However, the annual uncommitted runoff is only 802 MCM, which is less than half the amount of water needed to fill the aquifer-available I's void space. Through utilising artificial recharge and water conservation strategies, a plan is created for the basin's overused firkas only 88 MCM, or about 10% of the annual uncommitted runoff, totaling 202 crore rupees in expenditure.
      The hydrogeological, geophysical, and exploration data of the basin were critically analysed to determine the best locations for these structures. When choosing the Artificial Recharge structures, drainage and geomorphological factors are particularly weighted.
      Desilting and the building of recharge shafts inside the tanks are chosen for a total of 1811 Recharge Rejuvenation ponds. The 88 MCM range represents the anticipated recharge through these artificial recharge structures.
      The 75 OE and critical firka area recharge structures are anticipated to create an additional 5500 ha of paddy, 4400 ha of sugarcane, 8800 ha of banana, or 14667 ha of irrigated dry crops.
